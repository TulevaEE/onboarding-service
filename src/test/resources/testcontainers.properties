# Testcontainers configuration for test performance
#
# Container reuse keeps containers running between test runs for faster execution.
# This is especially useful during local development when running tests repeatedly.
#
# Note: Containers are automatically cleaned up when Docker Desktop restarts or
# when you manually remove them with: docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q --filter label=org.testcontainers=true)
#
testcontainers.reuse.enable=false

# Set to true for faster local development (optional):
# testcontainers.reuse.enable=true
