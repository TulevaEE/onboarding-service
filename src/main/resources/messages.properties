mandate.email.thirdPillar.greeting=Welcome {0},
mandate.email.thirdPillar.content=I’m glad you’ve decided to start saving in the third pillar with us. Below, you will find the necessary payment details and a few useful tips. Attached is a copy of your third pillar application, which we have sent to the Pension Registry.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.automate.title=It makes sense to automate your savings.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.automate.content=If you haven’t yet, set up automatic recurring payments in your internet bank, so you can be certain that you are always taking care of your future self. By spreading your purchases over the year, you are reducing the risk of buying stocks when they are at peak prices.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.calculate.title=Calculate your maximum tax break and if needed, start small.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.calculate.content=You will get the highest tax break if you contribute 15% of your gross income (but no more than 6,000 euros per year). <a href="https://tuleva.ee/en/iii-pillar/?utm_source=autoemail&utm_medium=clients&utm_campaign=sug_2&utm_content=kalkulaator">Here is a calculator to help with deciding.</a><br><br>Don’t be afraid if the amount seems too high at first. Start with a contribution that you are comfortable with: the sooner you begin, the bigger the impact of compound returns. You can always cancel your contributions if something unexpected happens.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.paymentDetails.subject=Important information about your 3rd pillar and a copy of the application
mandate.email.thirdPillar.paymentDetails.title=Here are the payment details for the recurring payment or a single contribution.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.paymentDetails.content=<i>Note that fund units appear on your third pillar account by the end of the next working day. If you pay in on Friday after 4pm or on the weekend, then the units will appear on your account by Tuesday afternoon.</i>
mandate.email.thirdPillar.swedbankInfo=<strong>*Attention!</strong> If you are making a deposit through Swedbank, you will see a message “Contributions to the third pillar fund can be made here”. Click the link, permit the bank to fetch your account data from Pensionikeskus and you will receive a pre-filled third pillar payment form. Choose the “According to the choice application” fund option and enter your desired purchase amount. You can then make a single contribution or set up a recurring payment.

mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.subject=Check where your second pillar is invested!
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.content=You have started to save in Tuleva’s third pillar fund with low fees and a fact-based investment strategy. I noticed that you are not investing your second pillar with us.<br><br>In a typical bank-run fund you pay up to three times more in fees than with Tuleva. You can check where your second pillar contributions go by <a href="https://pension.tuleva.ee/login?utm_source=autoemail&utm_medium=clients&utm_campaign=sug_2">logging in here</a>. Switching the fund is free of charge and takes only a few minutes.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.whySecond.title=Should you bring your second pillar to Tuleva?
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.whySecond.content=I would do that – actually, I have my second pillar in Tuleva World Stocks Pension Fund and my third pillar also with Tuleva.<br><br>In fact, banks also have low-cost index funds in their product offering, but only with Tuleva can you be sure that the good funds are not hidden among high-fee ones that have so far performed pretty badly. Nobody at Tuleva will try to convince you to switch back to a high-cost fund.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.diversification.title=Isn’t it better for risk diversification to keep my second pillar elsewhere?
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.diversification.content=All Estonian pension funds – both in the second and third pillar – have their assets well diversified among hundreds of investments. In addition, in all pension funds the investors are protected against the business risks of the fund manager. This is set in the Law and investors in pension funds themselves do not have to spread their assets between many fund managers for risk protection.<br><br>It is important to remember, however, that your money in pension funds is open to market risk. When world markets fall, all pension fund unit prices fall too. It does not help if your assets are spread among many fund managers.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.tutorial.title=Do you want to know why the second and third pillars are useful?
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.tutorial.content=<a href="https://tuleva.ee/en/recommendations/15-minutes/?utm_source=autoemail&utm_medium=clients&utm_campaign=sug_2&utm_content=laura_rikkaks">Read this short article</a> where I describe my investment portfolio, the foundation of which are the second and third pension pillars.

You will find that pension funds are very clever investment tools with significant tax advantages.
