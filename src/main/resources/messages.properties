mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.subject=Check where your second pillar is invested!
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.content=You have started to save in Tuleva’s third pillar fund with low fees and a fact-based investment strategy. I noticed that you are not investing your second pillar with us.<br><br>In a typical bank-run fund you pay up to three times more in fees than with Tuleva. You can check where your second pillar contributions go by <a href="https://pension.tuleva.ee/login?utm_source=autoemail&utm_medium=clients&utm_campaign=sug_2.1">logging in here</a>. Switching the fund is free of charge and takes only a few minutes.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.whySecond.title=Should you bring your second pillar to Tuleva?
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.whySecond.content=I would do that – actually, I have my second pillar in Tuleva World Stocks Pension Fund and my third pillar also with Tuleva.<br><br>In fact, banks also have low-cost index funds in their product offering, but only with Tuleva can you be sure that the good funds are not hidden among high-fee ones that have so far performed pretty badly. Nobody at Tuleva will try to convince you to switch back to a high-cost fund.
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.diversification.title=Isn’t it better for risk diversification to keep my second pillar elsewhere?
mandate.email.thirdPillar.suggestSecond.diversification.content=All Estonian pension funds – both in the second and third pillar – have their assets well diversified among hundreds of investments. In addition, in all pension funds the investors are protected against the business risks of the fund manager. This is set in the Law and investors in pension funds themselves do not have to spread their assets between many fund managers for risk protection.<br><br>It is important to remember, however, that your money in pension funds is open to market risk. When world markets fall, all pension fund unit prices fall too. It does not help if your assets are spread among many fund managers.
